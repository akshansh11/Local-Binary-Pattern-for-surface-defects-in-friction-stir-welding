# Local-Binary-Pattern-for-surface-defects-detection-in-friction-stir-welding
Friction Stir Welding process is an advanced solid-state joining process which finds application in various industries like automobiles, manufacturing, aerospace and railway firms. Input parameters like tool rotational speed, welding speed, axial force and tilt angle govern the quality of Friction Stir Welded joint. Improper selection of these parameters further leads to fabrication of the joint of bad quality resulting groove edges, flash formation and various other surface defects. In the present work, a texture based analytic machine learning algorithm known as Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is used for the extraction of texture features of the Friction Stir Welded joints which are welded at a different rotational speed. It was observed that LBP algorithm can accurately detect any irregularities present on the surface of Friction Stir Welded joint.
